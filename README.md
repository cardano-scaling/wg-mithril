# Mithril technical working group

Welcome to the documentation repository of the Mithril working group. It holds defining documents like the working group charter and procedural documentation like meeting notes.

> [!NOTE]
> The working group is currently being formed and a [dedicated git repository](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/wg-mithril) was chosen to form charter and processes. Perspectively individual documents may be moved / integrated to [intersect](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) or its [working group index](https://intersect.gitbook.io/intersect-working-groups) as the working group gets registered.

## Charter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The charter itself is in draft status and one of the first work items of the working group will be to ratify it.

### Why

> Why is this working group needed?

- Open discussion and governance of the [mithril](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril) project roadmap
- Identify and scope _fundable features_ and projects related to Mithril into a roadmap to be ratified by the community (e.g. through intersect)
- Break up silos and cross-pollinate projects across the broader domain of scaling Cardano transaction processing

### What

> What are we doing concretely?

- Prioritize and scope out [feature :rocket:](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/labels/feature%20%3Arocket%3A) from [features idea :bulb:](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/labels/idea%20%3Abulb%3A) and [ðŸ’¡ idea discussions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/mithril/discussions/categories/ideas).
- Create and maintain a high-level backlog of _fundable features and projects/RFPs_ (level of detail to be defined)
- Coordinate ratification by the community through Intersect
- Review and report on individual project deliveries
